# Testing

Like any javascript web application, we will be testing it using Cypress Tool for E2E Testing. A complete guide on how to use cypress is mentioned in this file.

## Cypress
### What is Cypress?

An open source, front-end testing tool which is useful for unit tests, integration tests, component tests and e2e tests. Since unit tests are the responsibility of the developer, and 
there are multiple uni tests tools available in each language such as Junit for Java, Pytest for Python, we use cypress mainly for E2E Tests. Cypress has everything a Software Tester wishes for: An impressive GUI, ease of use, high performance speed and a well known community. Moroever, there are several other benefits which can be highlighted too such as ease of 
installation, good documentation, well kept tutorials etc.
